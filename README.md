# 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

This aplication is (should be) a tech blog website. Unfortunately, it isn't in it's current state, but certain part have been implemeted to make the jump possible. The website has password salting to protect user privacy. A system relating Users, Posts and comments together works on the backend. The website homepage can display a bunch of pre seeded posts using the hadlebars render engine.
